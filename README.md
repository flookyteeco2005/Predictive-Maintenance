Data Sources¶  Common data sources for predictive maintenance problems are :      Failure history: The failure history of a machine or component within the machine.     Maintenance history: The repair history of a machine, e.g. error codes, previous maintenance activities or component replacements.     Machine conditions and usage: The operating conditions of a machine e.g. data collected from sensors.     Machine features: The features of a machine, e.g. engine size, make and model, location.     Operator features: The features of the operator, e.g. gender, past experience  The data for this example comes from 4 different sources which are real-time telemetry data collected from machines, error messages, historical maintenance records that include failures and maintenance
